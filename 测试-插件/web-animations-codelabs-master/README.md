## Background

Web Animations is a JavaScript API for driving animated content on the web. By unifying the animation features of SVG and CSS, Web Animations unlocks features previously only usable declaratively, and exposes powerful, high-performance animation capabilities to developers.

For more details see the [W3C specification](http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/), the [JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js), and [native browser support levels](http://caniuse.com/#feat=web-animation).
