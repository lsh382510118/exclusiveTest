# Transitions and Playback Control

This codelab will teach you how to use the Web Animations API to enhance a single-page HTML website. You'll add transitions between content, and use animations to support an effect based on the scroll position of the page.

The steps are available on the [Google I/O codelabs site](https://io2015codelabs.appspot.com/codelabs/web-animations-transitions-playbackcontrol).
