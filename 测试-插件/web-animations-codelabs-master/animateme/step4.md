## Step 4: Congratulations!

You've used the Web Animations API to animate a few dots around the screen, learning that animations can be configured programatically.

If you'd like to extend this codelab, try modifying the `timing` object passed through to `dot.animate`, or triggering animations based entirely on user events such as as click.

We've covered-

* Including the Web Animations API polyfill

* Animating with `Element.animate`

* Building unique keyframes at runtime

If you'd like to learn more, head back to [Web Animations Codelabs](https://github.com/samthor/web-animations-codelabs).
